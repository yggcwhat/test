BUG_Author: yggcwhat

Affected version:  Huocms

Vendor:https://huocms.com/


Source Code Address:  https://gitee.com/digital-flag/huocms

Vulnerability File: Upload.php

Affected Version：HuoCMS - <=V3.5.1

Description:
In the sliceUploadAndSave method of AttachmentController.php (located under app -> controller -> backend), the resource_type parameter is validated against a whitelist of allowed file extensions (e.g., txt, png, etc.). Subsequently, the method invokes tmpMove from Upload.php (under app -> service -> upload).

The tmpMove method first creates a file. However, the $filename parameter (controlled by the resource_temp_path input parameter, which is user-controllable) can be exploited to traverse directories (e.g., using ../) to create folders. The method then performs a move operation, placing the file into the created directory. The final filename is generated by appending an underscore and the $pos suffix, where $pos is controlled via the chunk_index parameter passed during the call (refer to the actual parameter passing for details).

This creates a vulnerability where an attacker could manipulate resource_temp_path and chunk_index to write files to arbitrary locations with controlled filenames.
